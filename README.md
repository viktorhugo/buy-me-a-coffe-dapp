# Buy Me a Coffee DApp

A modern full-stack application built with React Router, TypeScript, and modern development tools, designed to implement a "Buy Me a Coffee" DApp.

## Core Tools and Technologies

- **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/):** Advanced routing for React applications.
- **[React](https://react.dev/):** Main library for the UI.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** Static typing for JavaScript.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** Ultrafast bundler for development and production.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** CSS utility framework for fast and responsive styling.
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/):** Containerization for consistent deployment.
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/):** Fast alternative to npm/yarn for dependency management (optional).
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):** Runtime environment for the server.
- **[React Router Framework](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router):** Template and utilities for SSR and route structure.
- **[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/):** Cloud-based development (optional, see badge above).
